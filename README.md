# US-Census-Income-Optimization-EDA-Hypothesis-Testing-

# Problem Statement:
Income inequality remains a crucial issue, often influenced by factors such as education, occupation, gender, and work hours. To address this, we aim to analyze the U.S. Census Income dataset, exploring which demographic and economic characteristics are most strongly associated with income levels above or below 50,000 Dollars annually, The goal of this project is to analyze and understand the characteristics that differentiate high-income individuals (earning more than $50K) from those earning less. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover trends and patterns related to age, education, work hours and other demographic features. Additionally, hypothesis testing will be employed to assess the significance of key variables and determine if certain demographic factors (e.g., education level, marital status and work hours) have a statistically significant effect on income levels.

# Objectives:
The objective of this analysis is to identify and quantify the primary factors influencing income levels within the U.S. population using the census income dataset. By examining the relationships between income and key demographic, educational, and occupational variables, this study aims to determine the strongest income drivers, such as education, work hours, and occupation, while uncovering income disparities across various groups based on workclass, education, age, and marital status. The findings will provide actionable insights for policymakers, workforce development agencies, and businesses to design targeted interventions, including tailored training programs, equitable economic policies, and employment initiatives that enhance income opportunities and promote economic mobility.

# Dataset:
The Census Income dataset, also known as the Adult dataset, is a popular dataset derived from the 1994 U.S. Census, commonly used for classification tasks in data science. It consists of various demographic, economic, and educational attributes about individuals, providing insights into factors that may influence income levels. The target variable in this dataset is income, which categorizes individuals based on whether their annual income exceeds $50,000 (>50K) or not (<=50K). The features include demographic attributes such as age, sex, race, marital-status, and native-country, as well as economic and educational details like education, occupation, workclass, hours-per-week, capital-gain, and capital-loss. Each attribute offers a unique perspective on a personâ€™s background, education level, employment type, and income-generating activities, providing a comprehensive view of potential income influencers. The dataset includes both continuous and categorical variables, and missing values in some attributes may require data cleaning. The Census Income dataset is valuable for exploring patterns in income distribution, testing hypotheses around income inequality, and building predictive models to classify income levels based on a range of personal and professional factors.
